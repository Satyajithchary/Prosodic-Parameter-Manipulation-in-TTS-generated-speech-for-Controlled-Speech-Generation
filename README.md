# üé§ Prosodic Parameter Manipulation in TTS Generated Speech for Controlled Speech Generation

This repository contains the code and resources for the project **"Prosodic Parameter Manipulation in TTS Generated Speech for Controlled Speech Generation."** This project aims to improve the naturalness and expressiveness of TTS-generated speech by manipulating prosodic parameters. And this project is done as a part of IASNLP - 2024 at LTRC LAB, IIIT Hyderabad

## üéØ Introduction

The goal of this project is to enhance the naturalness of TTS-generated speech by adjusting prosodic parameters such as pitch (F0), duration, and intensity. By modifying these parameters, we aim to produce speech that is more expressive and closer to natural human speech.

## üìä Dataset

The datasets used in this project include both original human speech recordings and TTS-generated speech. These datasets are organized as follows:

- **Original Human Speech**:
  - Italian: `/content/drive/MyDrive/data (1)/data/wav/ITA/train`
  - German: `/content/drive/MyDrive/data (1)/data/wav/GER/train`
- **TTS-Generated Speech**:
  - Italian: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Audio_Files/ITA_Train_TTS_Audios`
  - German: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Audio_Files/GER_Train_TTS_Audios`

Additional data for stress patterns in speech is provided in:
- Italian stress training: `/content/ITA_train.xlsx`
- German stress training: `/content/GER_train.xlsx`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The methodology involves several steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert audio files to a suitable format for analysis.
2. **Prosodic Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as pitch (F0), duration, and intensity from the audio files.
3. **Prosodic Parameter Manipulation**: Modify the extracted prosodic parameters to achieve desired speech characteristics.
4. **Re-synthesis**: Generate modified speech using the manipulated prosodic parameters.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the modified speech with the original to evaluate the effectiveness of the manipulations.

The main steps in the code are as follows:
- Extract and manipulate F0 using `pyworld`.
- Modify duration and intensity based on prosodic patterns.
- Re-synthesize the modified speech using `pydub`.

## üìà Results

The results show significant improvements in the naturalness of TTS-generated speech. The following figures illustrate the comparison between original and modified F0 contours and spectral envelopes:

## üîÆ Future Scope

Future work could involve:
- Extending the methodology to other languages and dialects.
- Incorporating more sophisticated models for prosodic parameter manipulation.
- Improving the evaluation metrics to include subjective listening tests.
